**I. Core Language Features**

1. **Variables**

   * **`let`:**  The `let` keyword declares a variable.  Variables are used to store data.
     ```novalang
     let name = "Alice"; 
     let age = 30;
     ```
   * **Data Types:** Variables in NovaLang have data types. 
      * **`int`**: Integers (whole numbers)
      * **`float`**:  Floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points)
      * **`bool`**:  Boolean values (true or false)
      * **`string`**:  Textual data
      * **`char`**: Single character
      * **`Map`**: Key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`)
      * **`Set`**:  Unordered collection of unique elements (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`)
      * **`List`**:  Ordered collection of elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`)
      * **`Array`**:  Fixed-size arrays (e.g., `[int; 10]`) 
      * **`struct`**:  Define custom data structures to represent objects (e.g., `struct Person { name: string, age: int }`).
      * **`enum`**: Define sets of named constants (e.g., `enum Status { Pending, Approved, Rejected }`).

2. **Control Flow**

   * **`if-else`:**  Executes code based on a condition.
     ```novalang
     if (age > 18) {
         console.log("You are an adult.");
     } else {
         console.log("You are a minor.");
     }
     ```
   * **`for`:**  Repeats a block of code for each item in a sequence.
     ```novalang
     for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
         console.log(i);
     }
     ```
   * **`while`:**  Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
     ```novalang
     let count = 0;
     while (count < 5) {
         console.log("Counting:", count);
         count += 1;
     }
     ```
   * **`try...catch`:** Handles potential errors. 
     ```novalang
     try {
         let result = 10 / 0;
         console.log(result);
     } catch (error) {
         console.log("An error occurred:", error);
     }
     ```
   * **`switch`:**  Executes different code blocks based on the value of an expression.
     ```novalang
     let day = "Monday";
     switch (day) {
         case "Monday":
             console.log("It's the start of the week!");
             break;
         case "Friday":
             console.log("Almost the weekend!");
             break;
         default:
             console.log("It's just another day.");
     }
     ```
   * **`break`:**  Exits a loop prematurely.
   * **`continue`:** Skips to the next iteration of a loop.
   * **`return`:** Exits a function and optionally returns a value.

3. **Functions**

   * **Definition:**  
     ```novalang
     function greet(name: string) -> string {
         return "Hello, " + name + "!";
     }
     ```
   * **Calling a Function:**
     ```novalang
     console.log(greet("Bob")); // Output: Hello, Bob!
     ```

4. **Modules and Importing**

   * **`module`:** Create modules to organize code into logical units.
     ```novalang
     module Math {
         function add(x: int, y: int) -> int {
             return x + y;
         }
     }
     ```
   * **`import`:** Import modules to access their functions.
     ```novalang
     import Math;

     let sum = Math.add(5, 3);
     console.log(sum); // Output: 8
     ```

**II.  Key NovaLang Terminology**

* **Aio-Ready:** NovaLang is designed for asynchronous programming, enabling efficient handling of concurrent tasks and network operations (using `async` and `await`).
* **LLMs:**  Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI models used for tasks like text generation, translation, and code completion. NovaLang provides an `llm` library to interact with these models.
* **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are self-executing contracts stored on the blockchain. NovaLang's `contracts` library makes it easier to create and interact with smart contracts.
* **Modules:** Modules are used to organize code into logical units, improving code readability and reusability.
* **Package Manager:** NovaLang's `nova` package manager helps developers easily install, update, and manage libraries. 

**III.  Using NovaLang**

* **Web3 Integration:** 
* **AI Integration:** Use the `llm` library to work with LLMs for tasks like code generation, text summarization, and translation. 
* **Smart Contract Development:** Use the `contracts` library to create, deploy, and interact with smart contracts.
* **Asynchronous Programming:** Use the `async` and `await` keywords to write asynchronous code, making your applications more efficient. 

**IV.  Example**

```novalang
import web3;
import llm; 

function generate_description(product_name: string) -> string {
  let description = llm.generate_text(
    prompt: "Write a detailed description of a " + product_name + " product."
  );
  return description;
}

let product_name = "Smartwatch";
let product_description = generate_description(product_name);

console.log("Product description:", product_description);
```
